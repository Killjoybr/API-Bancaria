## How to run the app

With node 18.17.1 or newest run the app by writing on the console:

npm install 

node src/index.js

If everything went well you should have printed on your console that the app is running on a port (default: 8000).

## HTTP testing

I've created collections so testing each requisition is going to be easier. (thunder-collection)
